- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/johannsomosa/Portfolio/blob/2549671e0ce6bc1b31ec5204b73f5a8fecf1be93/world_layoffsscript.sql#L1-L158)
  
Analyzed dataset of 1000+ companies' layoffs between 2020-2023. Explored the dataset to identify any meaningful insights. The project records the SQL scripts utilized to find meaningful insights in the dataset. Examples include a top 5-rank system categorizing the companies that experienced the most layoffs between 2020-2023. Conducted monthly rolling totals for layoffs, ascending from the earliest date to the latest date. Identified which series start-up companies are most likely to experience the most layoffs. Prior to running EDA, a data cleaning project was conducted. The data cleaning project consisted of standardizing data, removing duplicates, and addressing null and blank values.

- Performed regression analysis on four educational factors against high school academic performance, across a random sample of 50 California highschools.
