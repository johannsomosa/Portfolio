Analyzed dataset of 1000+ companies' layoffs between 2020-2023. Explored the dataset to identify any meaningful insights. The project records the SQL scripts utilized to find meaningful insights in the dataset. Examples include a top 5-rank system categorizing the companies that experienced the most layoffs between 2020-2023. Conducted monthly rolling totals for layoffs, ascending from the earliest date to the latest date. Identified which series start-up companies are most likely to experience the most layoffs. Prior to running EDA, a data cleaning project was conducted. The data cleaning project consisted of standardizing data, removing duplicates, and addressing null and blank values.
